                Our employment and labour lawyers are known for their creative, business-oriented skills and, 
                when necessary, they are results-driven and highly successful litigators. CERTA represents local 
                and multinational businesses with respect to the full range of workforce-related issues, including 
                employment contracts, handbooks, and policies. The employment lawyers at CERTA will work closely 
                with your management and human resources professionals to develop and maintain clear, suitable 
                employee handbooks and policies carefully tailored to meet your business objectives. When it comes 
                to employment contracts, we can help you draft strong, enforceable restrictive covenants and other 
                provisions that clearly inform employees of their duties to their employer and protect you against 
                the loss of confidential information, customers, and other employees.
